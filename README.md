# Babel & Webpack Starter
The code is largely based on [a tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWUR04B42Hc) by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/babel_webpack_starter) back in 2017. I have updated a few lines to ensure it is in working condition.

## Installation
```
npm init
npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpack
```
## How-to
Start webpack-dev-server
```
npm start
```
Stop the server by *Ctrl + C*

## Build
```
npm run build
```
